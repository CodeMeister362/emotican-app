        <h2>What is surprise?</h2>
        <p>People are surprised when something unexpected happens.</p>
        <p>Maybe there was a loud noise, like a balloon popping, or a door slamming, and it startled them. Maybe something turned out differently than they thought it would, like a good grade on a test that they thought the did badly on, or getting a birthday present they didn't think they would receive.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the feelings of surprise are good. Sometimes it is bad or unpleasant. People can be happy when they are surprised, but sometimes they can be angry or scared when they are surprised.</p>
        <p>What are some times you have felt surprised lately?</p>
        <p>How did you feel after you were surprised?</p>
